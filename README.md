### To practice, the dataset used will be a breakdown of Military Expenditure by Country from 2016-2018

#### The Dataset includes the following fields:

+ Name: Name of the Country, Grouped Regional or Semi-autonomous Power
+ Abbreviation: Abbrevation of Country, Region or Semi-autonomous Power
+ Type: Country, Grouped Regional or Semi-autonomous Power
+ Indicator Name: Financial Indicator ($ USD)
+ 2016: Year 
+ 2017: Year
+ 2018: Year

#### Purpose:

### As a data scientist, it is important to have a solid understanding of basic probability and statistics concepts, such as:

+ Probability distributions (e.g. normal, binomial, Poisson)
+ Descriptive statistics (e.g. mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation)
+ Inferential statistics (e.g. estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals)
+ Correlation and regression analysis
+ Bayesian statistics
+ Time series analysis and forecasting
+ Statistical learning and machine learning methods (e.g. supervised and unsupervised learning, decision trees, random forests, neural networks)

Using Descriptive Statistics, apply different calculations to measure insights such as:

+ Countries that average the highest/lowest spending
+ Countries above and below average
+ Grouping coutries by percentiles
+ More to add as the project progresses

#### What concepts will be practiced?

+ Estimates of Location
+ Estimates of Variability
+ Exploring Data Distribution
+ Binary and Categorical Data
